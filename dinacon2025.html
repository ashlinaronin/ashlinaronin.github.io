        I came to the Digital Naturalism Conference 2025 (Bali, Indonesia) with
        two rough project ideas. The first was to create a kinetic sound
        sculpture using found materials, and the second was to record underwater
        sounds at coral reef restoration sites in Les.

      <p>
        In the last few years I have been working to reduce my reliance on
        computers and speakers when making sound, in order to engage more with
        the physical realm. I brought a few solenoids (which use an
        electromagnet to forcefully move a small piece of metal forward and
        backward), a peristaltic pump (which moves liquid by squeezing a tube),
        and the necessary batteries, flyback diodes, transistors, and motor
        drivers to Dinacon, but had no real plan for how I would put them
        together. My initial week of Covid isolation provided me with ample time
        to experiment.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first iteration of the piece was hot glued to a coconut. Two
        medium-sized solenoids bonked out the rhythm of a kotekan gamelan
        pattern on another coconut. The kotekan is an essential feature of
        Balinese gamelan, consisting of two relatively high-pitch parts which
        elaborate the basic melody in beautifully intertwined syncopated
        patterns. I borrowed some notation for the rhythms for these parts from
        the book Balinese Gamelan Music by Michael Tenzer. In order to reference
        the abrupt and dynamic tempo changes in Balinese gong kebyar, I included
        4 different tempos and added a mechanical switch to change between them.
        The large solenoid bonked the water glass, representing the gong at the
        end of each measure. The pump moved water between the glass and the
        coconut, changing the pitch of the bonks by varying the amount of water
        in each vessel.

      />

      <p>
        This was a fun proof of concept, which used locally foraged materials
        and evoked the sound of gamelan. Luci and I added some contact mics and
        used it for the basis of a deranged noise set that we performed from our
        Covid cabin. However, there were a few issues—the pump wasn't moving
        enough water to noticeably change the pitch, the switch didn't work
        reliably, and all the pieces had to be delicately rebalanced every few
        minutes to keep it working.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a few days' break from the piece, William provided some
        inspiration for a new direction when he mentioned a Ralf Schreiber
        circuit called Pulse and Pattern that he had built at a previous event.
        It lets you tap out a pattern on a switch, then plays it back using a
        motor. We modified the code and circuit to use the three solenoids
        instead (with help from Andy), and I swapped in some heavy duty arcade
        switches. When I presented the work at Open Day, local people from Les
        Village as well as Dinacon participants were able to try out the
        sculpture, programming their own rhythms into it and listening back on
        the fly. Luci helped me refine the presentation by placing the sculpture
        on a banana leaf, alongside a variety of sounding materials gathered for
        people to play with. This version was less explicitly gamelan inspired,
        but more interactive and fun. Folks were very engaged!

      <h2>Deep listening</h2>

      <p>
        Scientists believe many underwater creatures use sound for
        communication, navigation, hunting, and reproduction. But we have very
        limited knowledge of who's making the sounds and what they mean,
        especially compared to terrestrial animals like birds. This mystery
        intrigues me. I was curious how much I could learn about the nature of
        the reef sounds by looking for patterns in recordings, both with my ears
        and with assistance from software. If the reefs (and coral nursery
        tables) could be understood sonically, could sound then be used to
        survey the success of Sea Communities' coral plantings?
      </p>

      <p>
        To try to answer these questions, I made a series of recordings. I
        started with HydroMoths, off-the-shelf self-contained underwater
        recorders made by Open Acoustic Devices. They are easy to use and
        deploy, and can record from hours to days or even weeks in the field.
        Hence they are widely used for Passive Acoustic Monitoring, long-term
        recordings without human intervention. Since I was in Covid quarantine
        at the time, Paula and the Sea Communities dive guides helped place and
        retrieve the HydroMoths for me: one at a coral nursery table and one at
        a more established reef. I set the recorders to a sample rate of 384kHz,
        so that sounds above the range of human hearing would be captured. This
        meant the files were very large, and each captured only about 10 hours
        of sound before using up its respective SD card. I also filled the
        recorders' waterproof cases with baby oil to improve their acoustic
        coupling with the surrounding water.

      />

      <p>
        On the HydroMoth recordings, I heard pistol shrimp, toadfish, some
        gurgling, diver sounds, boats, and many unidentified sounds which were
        presumably fish vocalizations. I didn't see anything above the human
        hearing range on the spectrogram, and since these recordings took place
        from about 10am to 8pm on a single day, they weren't long enough to
        extrapolate diurnal patterns. With the help of the dive guides, I placed
        the HydroMoths for another series of recordings with a lower sample rate
        that should enable them to record for a few days. Though I am leaving
        before they can be retrieved, Logan has agreed to steward the HydroMoths
        for the next several weeks of Dinacon. His research indicates that fish
        have dawn and dusk choruses, like many other animals—so we are both
        curious to hear what we learn from this latest round of recordings.
      </p>

      <p>
        I processed the HydroMoth recordings with the open-source bioacoustics
        software LEAVES, created by researcher Thomas Napier, which is designed
        to simplify the technique of unsupervised classification (categorizing
        sounds without trying to specifically identify them). So far the results
        have indicated several clusters of theoretically related sounds, but the
        groupings don't seem to line up with what I'm hearing. More
        experimentation is in order.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I emerged from quarantine, Luci and I commissioned a fishing boat
        to record the reefs from the surface using Zoom field recorders and
        Aquarian hydrophones dangled into the sea. This method produced high
        quality recordings and the feedback was more immediate since we were
        able to listen live via headphones, but the duration of the recordings
        was limited to our physical presence on the water. Since we had some
        engine malfunctions and translation challenges, we didn't get much
        material from this expedition, though it was a fun adventure with great
        sunset views.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, can sound be used to understand the coral reefs in Les village? The
        established reef definitely sounds more active than the coral table. It
        will take more experimentation with the forthcoming HydroMoth recordings
        to get a more specific answer. Hopefully the next wave of Dinasaurs can
        make some breakthroughs!

        Kennedy, Andy Quitmeyer and Luci Dayhew for help on these projects.
